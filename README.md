### Hello ðŸ‘‹ Glad you're here

- I'm a Django developer and budding ML hobbyist
- Currently learning about: Cryptography and Linux
- When I'm not at my laptop you can find me playing my guitar, learning piano or studying physics (or completing my always overdue schoolwork ;))
- I can be contacted at my email given on my github profile.
